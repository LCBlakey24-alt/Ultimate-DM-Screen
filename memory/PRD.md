### RULES CONSISTENCY PASS - EDITION-AWARE SYSTEM (March 8, 2026)
**Full rules-consistency pass for character creation + level-up with strict 5e 2014/2024 support**

**Runtime Bug Fixes:**
- Fixed undefined variable errors in character creation payload (`selectedSpells`, `selectedCantrips`, `selectedFeat`)
- All spell/cantrip/feat selections now properly reference `characterData.*` properties
- Added proper error handling for 400 validation errors from backend

**Data Model Consistency:**
- Added `cantrips_known` field to `PlayerCharacter` model
- Normalized spell inputs to object format `{name, level}` for consistency
- Separate fields: `spells_known` (for known-spell casters), `spells_prepared` (for prepared casters), `cantrips_known`
- Backend normalizes any format to `{name, level}` objects before storage

**Edition-Aware Rule Enforcement:**
- Subclass options disabled in UI when character level < unlock level
- Clear messaging shows why subclass is locked ("Subclass Locked - Clerics choose at level 1 in 2014 rules")
- Backend validates subclass on both CREATE and UPDATE endpoints
- New endpoint `GET /characters/{id}/level-up-info` returns edition-aware subclass timing
- Level-up info includes: unlock level, can_choose_now, needs_selection, ASI levels, HP info

**Test Coverage (25 tests):**
- Subclass validation for 2014 edition (Cleric L1, Wizard L2, Sorcerer L1, etc.)
- Subclass validation for 2024 edition (all classes L3)
- Hit dice calculation per class (Barbarian d12, Wizard d6, Fighter d10)
- max_hit_points auto-calculation with CON modifier
- Spell and cantrip persistence in object format
- Level-up-info endpoint returns correct edition-aware data

### EDITION-AWARE CHARACTER CREATION (March 8, 2026)
- **Edition selection**: Players choose 2014 or 2024 rules at the start of character creation
- **Edition-specific subclass levels**:
  - 2014: Class-specific (Cleric/Sorcerer/Warlock at 1, Druid/Wizard at 2, others at 3)
  - 2024: All classes get subclass at level 3
- **Spell/cantrip limits**: Now calculated from rules tables, not hardcoded
  - Shows exact cantrip count based on class and level
  - Prepared vs known spell distinction for different class types
- **Edition-specific SRD races**: Shows appropriate races for selected edition
- **Backend validation**: Rejects illegal subclass selection before unlock level
- **Proper HP calculation**: Uses correct hit dice per class (d12 Barbarian, d6 Wizard, etc.)
- **Data payload fix**: Fixed `max_hp` → `max_hit_points` mismatch between frontend/backend
- **New data file**: `frontend/src/data/editionRules.js` contains all edition-specific rules

### JSON UPLOAD INSTRUCTIONS (March 8, 2026)
- **Upload modal enhanced**: Shows required/optional fields for each content type
- **Dynamic instructions**: Changes based on selected content type (classes, races, spells, etc.)
- **Better sample JSON**: Realistic examples with Blood Hunter, Dhampir, custom spells

### DYNAMIC COMBAT TAB FEATURES (March 8, 2026)
- **Class-specific abilities**: Combat tab now dynamically displays actions, bonus actions, reactions, and passives based on character class and level
- **Data source**: `frontend/src/data/classFeatures.js` contains comprehensive feature data for all 12 D&D 5e classes
- **Implementation**: `combatFeatures` useMemo hook in `CharacterSheetFull.js` filters and aggregates features
- **Multiclass support**: Aggregates features from all classes without duplicates for multiclass characters
- **Level filtering**: Only shows features the character has actually unlocked at their current level
- **Feature types displayed**:
  - CLASS ACTIONS (Divine Sense, Lay on Hands, Channel Divinity, Action Surge, Wild Shape, etc.)
  - ATTACK MODIFIERS (Divine Smite, Sneak Attack, Reckless Attack, Stunning Strike)
  - BONUS ACTIONS (Rage, Second Wind, Cunning Action, Ki abilities, Bardic Inspiration)
  - REACTIONS (Deflect Missiles, Uncanny Dodge, Indomitable, Slow Fall)
  - PASSIVE ABILITIES (Fighting Style, Extra Attack, Evasion, Unarmored Defense)
- **Uses tracking**: Shows uses per rest (short/long) for limited abilities
- **Test coverage**: 19 new E2E tests in `tests/e2e/combat-tab-class-features.spec.ts`

### FREE TIER RESTRICTIONS IMPLEMENTED (March 7, 2026)

- **Implementation:**

  - Checkout sessions created with fixed prices from backend (security best practice)
